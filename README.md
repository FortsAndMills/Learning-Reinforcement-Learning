# Learning Reinforcement Learning:
Algorithms from DQN to Rainbow with unified interface.

* **Theory overview**: [Theory Overview](https://github.com/FortsAndMills/Learning-Reinforcement-Learning/tree/master/Theory%20Overview) - conspect of articles about implemented algorithms.
* **LRL Demo**: [LRL demo.ipynb](https://github.com/FortsAndMills/Learning-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/LearningRL%20-%20Demo.ipynb) Library interface guide.
* **LRL Cartpole**: [LRL Playing with cartpole.ipynb](https://github.com/FortsAndMills/Learning-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/LRL%20Playing%20with%20cartpole.ipynb) - launching a bunch of algorithms on the simplest environment Cartpole.

## Requirements:

# UPDATES
specially for my beloved scientific advisor:
* **23/09/18** Added detailed review of basic policy gradient algorithms: baselines for REINFORCE, Actor-Critic, Advantage Actor-Critic. Minor updates on rubik's cube solution attempts.
